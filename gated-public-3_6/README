I. Overview

   This release of GateD uses GNU autoconf to detect platform-specific
   configuration options.  You do not need to install autoconf to
   build gated.  By default, gated is compiled with all protocols
   available in the license under which it was distributed.
   Should you wish to disable support certain protocols, see
   Section IV at the end of this document.

II. Getting started - building one GateD binary.

   In the simplest case, you just want to compile gated for a
   single architecture, with all protocols supported.  The procedure for
   doing this is just:

    cd gated-xxx
    ./configure
    make depend
    make

    You *must* run make depend before running make!

III. Compiling gated for multiple platforms

   In the more general case, you may want to compile gated-5.0 for
   multiple platforms.  In this case, you should not build gated in
   the original location (i.e., don't follow the steps in section II).
   If you have already done section II, you may clean out the original
   location by doing "make cleanall".  This removes files created by
   ./configure in addition to those created by make ("make clean" only
   removes files created by make).

   To build gated for a new platform, you must first create a build
   directory manually.  (The architecture type is NOT sufficient to
   uniquely identify the features supported by the machine, so gated
   will no longer guess a build directory to use.  Different machines
   can vary in the kernel options enabled, which compiler is available,
   etc.)

   In the examples below, we will use gated-uni/obj/<machinename>
   as the build directory.  If the machinename is "excelsior", you
   would do:

      cd gated-xxx
      mkdir -p obj/excelsior
      cd obj/excelsior
      ../../configure --srcdir=../../
      make depend
      make

      Again, you *must* run make depend before running make!

IV. Enabling/disabling support for specific protocols

    Protocols can be enabled or disabled by passing flags to the
    "configure" script.  For a list of available protocols, use:

    ./configure --help

    For example, to compile the GateD binary without the RIP
    protocol or the GateD Interactive Interface and with 
    RSd support, use:

    ./configure --disable-rip --disable-gii --enable-rsd

    If you would like to build with only a few protocols, you may
    find the --disable-all flag useful.  This turns off all protocols
    and a small subset can then be enabled.

V. Notes

The autoconf'ed versions of GateD have been tested on the following
platforms.  This is by no means an exhaustive list:

	BSD/OS 2.x, 3.x, 4.x
	FreeBSD	2.2.x, 3.x
	NetBSD 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
	Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6
	SunOS 4.1.4
	Linux 2.2.13 - 2.2.14
	Linux 2.3.39
	OpenBSD 2.5

Ports are underway for HP-UX 10.x and 11.x, Linux, and Digital Unix.
