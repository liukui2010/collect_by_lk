	  	these tests replace some 'ifdef linux' tests
               	[rusty 19990515]
	gated, mbr - numerous changes  [rusty 19990515]
	dvmrp.c - change INCLUDE_MROUTE_KERNEL to
		INCLUDE_MROUTE [rusty 19990515]
	gii - changes for printing pim rpset and upstream
		info [rusty 19990515]

		the corresponding include. [rusty 19990515]
	gated - replaced '#ifdef linux' test to
		appropriate autoconf tests, for the following:

	gated - put BREAKS_REDHAT def around linux/in_system.h
		added a test INCLUDE_LINUX, to include the local
		linux.h.  linux.h was created to overcome including
		<linux/*.h> headers.  according to linux enthusiasts,
		the linux directory is kernel only.  including files
		from this dir can often lead to conflicting def's, yet
		contains struct def's gated needs, in particular
		ip_mroute.h related things.  to overcome this we'll
		just maintain our own header until this gets
		straigtened out. [rusty 19990515]
	krt_ipmulti_ttl0 - added 'mfc_' prefix to krt_request fields, these are 
		just macros.
		set (u_char) typecast for setting ttls in the mfcctl

		for reading interfaces in a 2.2 kernel. [rusty 19990515]
	src/gated/mroute.c - remove INCLUDE_MROUTE_KERNEL [rusty 19990515]
	mbr.h - changes to 'struct krt_request': added field prefix
		'mfc_' to fields or created an 'mfc_*' def.  trying to 
		be consistent with the rest of the code.

		- added fields to krt_request: task *mfc_owner,
		upstream_t *mfc_upstream, added mfc_dstable to set
		vifs.  actually mfc_upstream was already there it was
		used but ignored, i changed it's usage to be set by
		the m-igp according to who it thought it's upstream
		nbr should be.

		- added KRTREQ_REJECT. this allows the owner to tell the 
		mbr that the requested (s,g) should be rejected by the 
		mbr.  the mbr places a neg cache entry in to the
		kernel to stop futher process of corresponding data.
		in relation, i added an mbr_neg_cache() function to
		add neg cache entries to the kernel.
		[rusty 19990515]
	mrt - added ds_table[] to the downstream interface.
		added ds_rtbits in addition to dsprotos

	multicast_mib.c - surronded in_var.h, nlist.h and libelf/nlist.h with
		appropriate ifdef's. [rusty 19990515]

	ptree - added new generic patricia tree code [chopps 19990429]
	gqueue.h - added new generic list macros [chopps 19990429]
	autoconf - modified autoconf to allow specifying --with-<proto>
		with default being all supported by OS [chopps 19990429]
	autoconf - only compile needed source files [chopps 19990429]
	str.c - support for alternate LL_ADDR printing [chopps 19990429]

		with freebsd [chopps 19990429]
	autoconf - many changes for HP-UX 10.x, FreeBSD 3.1 (some from eddy@isi.edu)
		[naamato 990429]
	new_ospf - merged new ospf code (from chopps) into library. [naamato 990429]
	dvmrp - fixed a bug which prevented a designated router from re-assuming
		the DR role after a source would become reachable again after a
		period of unreachability. [ala 990422]
	mbr.c - Fixed a bug in mbr_sg_add_downstream2 whereby the wrong upstream
		interface was being inserted into the kernel's multicast forwarding
		cache.o. [ala 990422]
	dvmrp_mib - Fixed a bug in o_dvmrpRouteNextHopTable whereby an snmp
		query containing a non-contiguous netmask would cause gated to core.
		[ala 990422]
	ospf_monitor - fixed spelling error. [naamato 990408]
	dvmrp_targets.c - Fixed a bug in dvmrp_td_remove which caused gated to
		core when interface running dvmrp would be configured down then up.
		[ala 990322]
	compat/flock - Fix broken #define's that prevented gdc from working in
		Solaris. [naamato 990312].
	task.c - Use mmap() with MAP_ANON (added by chopps) if supported by the
		underlying OS. [naamato 990312]
	smux - RFC1227 SMUX implementation rewritten to use CMU-based 
		UCD-SNMP library instead of the obsolete ISODE code.
		The SMUX code now uses a separate task and is available
		as an alternative to the embedded CMU agent. [naamato 990111]
	snmpdlib - The embedded CMU agent modified to use the updated
		UCDavis library. [naamato 990111]
	snmplib  - The SNMP library has been updated to UCDavis release 3.5.3.
	ospf_init.c - ignore assert that can fail when changing netmask [chopps 990122] 
	ospf_init.h - don't use depricated area->authtype to determine 
		the trailer size of the packet for authentication, 
		instead use the interface authentication field. [chopps 990122]
	pimdm.c - Fixed pimdm_sg_creation_recv() and pimdm_assert_downstream.
		PIMDM oifs are now merged with the kernel request's
		downstream list instead of being added individually.
		Changed the amount of time that scheduled prunes are 
		delayed.  Different pimdm spec revisions are inconsistent 
		in their wording, but it currently says that joins should 
		be sent in time less-than-or-equal-to 3 seconds.  Thus, 
		prunes should be scheduled in time strictly greater-than 
		3 seconds (4 seconds for gated). Regardless, it doesn't 
		hurt compatibility to delay an extra second. [eddy@isi.edu]
	ospf - Only allow stub hosts to be either p2p or loopback. [wfs 981130]
	ospf_monitor - Fixed spelling error in ospf_monitor.
                ospf_rxmon.c [wfs 981130]
        ospf_monitor - Fix incorrect handling of interface alias on solaris machines.
                [wfs 990123]
        task - Added code to run Gated under purify.  [wfs 990123]
        parser.y.unf - parser now checks that c-rp configured addrs are
		mcast group addresses. [eddy@isi.edu 981124]
	gii.c - updated the information printed for 'sh ip pim c-rp'
	bgmp.c - added some packet tracing code [eddy@isi.edu 981124]
	krt_lladdr_sunos4.c
		the ioctl's in krt_lladdr() seem to be broke,
		so we use the parameter info if available to
		avoid calling the broke ioctl's. [rusty 991123]
	krt_ifread_ioctl.c
		added dump_ifrp() from the old code back into
		this file and call it from krt_ifread().  simply
		for diagnostics. [rusty 991123]
	src/gated/Makefile.in
		added bgmp_mbr.[co] to the Makefile.in, needed for
		bgmp. [rust 991123]
Changes by rusty 11/20/98
	bgmp.[ch] and bgmp_mbr.c
		   more general development

	dvmrp.c, gii.c, multicast_mib.c
		added '#define INCLUDE_MROUTE_KERNEL' above include.h
		to cause ip_mroute.h kernel define to be included.

	include.h
		netbsd uses the define _KERNEL as opposed to KERNEL,
		this is needed for ip_mroute.h

	krt_ifread_ioctl.c
		added a (char *) type cast to avoid compiler warnings

	krt_ipmulti_ttl0.c, mbr.[hc]:
		added INCLUDE_MROUTE_KERNEL and replace
		krt_generate_cache() with mbr_handle_upcall(). 

	mroute.c
		added mbr_handle_upcall() and in igmp_recv(), moved
		the len and checksum sanity checks to before the
		mbr_handle_upcall(), since upcalls must do the same.

	mrt.[hc]:
		added INCLUDE_MROUTE_KERNEL and some global wildcard
		sockaddrs.  also changed genericised mrt flags and
		extended them to 32 bits from 8 bits.

	parse.c:
		added strings for threshold-dr and threshold-rp for
		pimsm configuration options.

	parser.y.unf:
		pim configuration changes

	pim.[ch], pim_mib.c, pimdm.c and pimsm.c
		INCLUDE_MROUTE_KERNEL and configuration support for
		changes.  pimdm sender_is_member (small change).
		pimsm now allows c-rp configuration for group ranges
		of the type:

		   crp {
		       225.1.0.0 masklen 16;
		       225.2.1.0 masklen 24;
		   };

		rip.c	   cwr
	Change to RIP configuration.  Will now run rip only on interfaces configured

                chopps
        Added patch to correctly log information regarding BGP optional
                parameters (currently unsupported in gated).  [gnats 216]
                bgp.c, bgp_init.c, bgp_proto.h, bgp_rt.c, bgp_var.h
                swright
        Added patch to prevent coredumps when routes are received with

                bgp_rt.c        swright    
	Replaced ASpath handler with extended ASPath regexp handler derived
		from rsd	khuon
        Fixed problem freeing ASpath memory.  [gnats 41]
                asmatch.c       swright
Minor cleanup and doc changes to dvmrp_targets.c.  
Added Extended RIB support.  Now possible to support more than 2 RIBS.
  Setting PROTO_RSD in options file defines EXTENDED_RIBS which causes
  additional flag words to be included in the rt_head and rt_entry 
  structures to handle up to 32 RIBs.  Some function calls were modified
  to handle passing of RIB bits outside of the rt_state flags.
  Not defining EXTENDED_RIBS will continue to support the Unicast and Multicast
  RIBs in the same way as prior combo versions.

                rt_table.c, rt_table.h
Fixes to dvmrp_routing.c gii.c
  Fixed the case where the router upon which we are dependent for a route
  decides that it is dependent on our upstream interface for the route.  The
  spec. says to ignore this but this is wrong.  The code needs to treat this
  as if the route is now unreachable in the downstream router.

  Ensure that rth1_info is freed from rt_head.  Fix related bug in gii

  >  Problem:

  >      DVMRP crashes in the dvmrp_graft_timeout() function

  >  How to reproduce:

  >      H1 ------ R1  -------- R2  --------- R3  -------- H3
  >
  >
  >      ( H1, H2 and H3 are hosts. R1, R2, and R3 are routers running
  >        Gated)
  >
  >     - bring up R1, R2 and R3.
  >     - bring up a multicast application on H3 (such as whiteboard)
  >       with a group G1. Send some multicast data from H3.
  >     - R1 will send a prune.
  >     - put Gated on R2 in gdb and put a break point in the function
  >       dvmrp_recv_graft().
  >     - bring up multicast application on H1 with the same group G1.
  >     - R1 will send  a graft and gdb on R2 will hit the breakpoint.
  >       Let the gated remain at the gdb prompt. (i.e. don't make R2
  >       send graft-ack to R1)
  >     - R1 will crash in dvmrp_graft_timeout() function.
